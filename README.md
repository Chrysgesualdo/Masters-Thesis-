## Summary:
I investigated the effects of parental involvement in a sports-based HIV prevention program on self-efficacy and safe sex behavior among youth. I first developed a research-based parental intervention to include in the program. Then, I designed a quasi-experimental study with 90 participants aged 13-24, split into experimental (with parental component) and control (without parental component) groups. Using SPSS, I performed ANCOVA, independent t-tests, and crosstab analyses to assess changes. Results showed a positive impact of the implemented intervention on self-efficacy and safe sex behavior.
